# Health Insurance Cost Prediction Using Regression (IT203 Course Project)

Insurance is a policy that tries to decrease costs incurred by accident or illness.This can be influenced by various factors.
We use different regression techniques to predict the cost of insurance and compare the results.
We compare the results from Linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge Regression, Polynomial regression, Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor.

| Model        | Mean Squared Error | Mean Absolute Error  | Root mean Squared error |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Linear Regression | 0.0334 | 0.1321 | 0.1892 
| Ridge Regression | 0.0334 | 0.1146 | 0.1827  
| Lasso Regression | 0.0572 | 0.1732 | 0.2392    
| Polynomial Regression | 0.0217 | 0.0927 | 0.1475 
| Decision Tree Regression | 0.0504 | 0.1114 | 0.2246 
| Random Forest Regression | 0.0223 | 0.0854 | 0.1493   

## Results and Conclusion
From the above table we can see that the polynomial regression model fits best and has the best metrics compared to the other models.
